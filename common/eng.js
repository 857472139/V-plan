			'I. Introduction to Vplan',

			"Vplan is an intelligent contract DApp developed by the Ethereum technical team and deployed on the Ethereum corporate chain. To attract and expand more ethereum community fans, create and prosper ethereum community ecology. In Vplan, the technical team innovatively introduced atomic exchange technology. Atomic exchange is a technology that enables the rapid exchange of two cryptocurrencies running on different blockchain networks and is essentially a point-to-point transaction across the chain. Based on a smart contract, it allows users to exchange the tokens they want directly from an encrypted wallet. Atomic exchange technology with almost zero operating costs makes transactions easier and more convenient, accelerates the circulation performance of different tokens, and ultimately improves the value of the token itself.",

			'Ii. Intelligent Contract Rule Interpretation',

			'1. To implement the intelligent contract deployed by the ethernet public chain, the rules can not be tampered with, which ensures fairness',

			'2. Real-time synchronization of ethereum network with all nodes and blocks, 100% distribution of all assets, absolute security of assets;',

			'3. Yi Tai Fong ecology, with the consensus basis of global players, to ensure the acceptance of players;',

			'4. Business rules are simple but not simple, easy to share and copy, ensuring the rapid multiplication of the team; ',

			'5. The model is scientific and reasonable, in line with the laws of the market, sharing plans to enjoy high returns. ',
			'Iii. Contract Scheme',
			'1.Planned earnings (0.9% daily earnings) ',

			'B. Directly push 2 people to receive 20% of the benefits of the 2g plan;',
			'C. Direct promotion of 3-10 people to get 10% of the benefits of the 3-10 generation plan, direct promotion of several people to get several generations, at most 10 generations. ',
			'3. Share the income (unlimited generational differential system, enjoy 2% of the first-generation equal prize)',
			'A.V1 three markets, each market up to 300ETH, with team plan income 5%;',
			"B.V2 three markets each generate a V1, take team plan income 10%;",
			"C.V3 three markets each generate a V2, take the team plan income 15%; ",
            "D.V4 three markets each generate a V3, take the team plan income 20%",
			'Note: all income will be automatically out after reaching the corresponding multiple of exit. After being out, all income will stop and the original structure will remain unchanged. After the return to the original position, continue to enjoy the corresponding benefits.',
			'IV. Allocation of Funds',
			'1. Founding team: 3% for Vplan team founding;',
			"2. Bonus pool: 5% of the funds entered into the bonus pool; 20% of them are allocated to the top 10 recommendations of the day, and TOP1 gets 50%; TOP2 gets 20%; TOP3 gets 10%; Top4-top10 distributes 20% evenly, with the remaining 80% rolling into the next round. ",
			'3. 10% of all proceeds will go into the insurance pool until the number of insurance pools reaches 5000, and then the rest will be rolled into the Contract V pool. When the contract V pool capital is less than 10, the ETH of the insurance pool is equally allocated to the last 490 addresses to be added, and the last one receives 10 times the amount invested.',
